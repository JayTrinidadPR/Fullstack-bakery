        <p>
          At Fullstack Bakery, we fuse old-school baking traditions with a modern twist.
          Everything is mixed, kneaded, and crafted by hand, because good food takes time,
          patience, and a whole lot of love. From warm sourdough loaves to melt-in-your-mouth
          pastries, every bite is made to make your day a little better.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our bakers start before sunrise, whipping up doughs, icings, fillings,
          and flaky layers that have become the talk of the neighborhood.
          Whether you're here for a quick treat, a show-stopping cake,
          or your weekly bread fix, you're in the right place.
